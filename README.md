# [Master's thesis - Aeroelastic Tailoring of Helicopter Main Rotor Blade] (https://github.com/franrod98/master_thesis)

## Abstract
  The baseline concept of aeroelastic tailoring is to gain control over the in-flight deformation of a lifting surface
to manipulate the generation of external aerodynamic loads, to improve the overall aircraft performance. Active
and passive technologies have been significantly studied to evaluate the benefits of the aeroelastic methodologies.
However, the implementation of passive aeroelastic tailoring methods in helicopter design is significantly
understudied. In this thesis is intended to study the aeroelastic behavior of an elastic rotor blade model during
flight. The study is framed to is evaluate if a single rotor blade can perform as a passive smart structure, adapting
its geometry to different flight conditions, ultimately reducing the overall power consumption. A global evaluation
integrating both aerodynamic and structural analyses is performed to predict the performance of the developed
blade models in both hovering and forward flight conditions. A highly automated framework was designed to
minimize the overall computational time and user input requirements, connecting all commercial software included
in the project and automatically executing every major and intermediate procedure.
